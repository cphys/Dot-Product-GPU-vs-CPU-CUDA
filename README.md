# Dot product CPU vs GPU

Compares dot product accuracy and calculation time calculated with GPU/CUDA vs CPU

## Instructions
* running make file will create executable.
* Running executable will output the value of the dot product calculated using both the CPU and GPU
* a comparison of the accuracy be done by calculating the % difference between the values
* calculation times will be given along with time taken to transfer data to and from the GPU

## To Do
* Improve documentation and commenting
